Translation 3: 
Glossary and notes 
Note: the verb sum, esse, fui, futurus has no present participle! If you want to construct the equivalent of a normal verbal unit using a participle with a noun, you can simply omit the verb “to be” and include the predicate (just as you can with finite forms of sum: Herculis fortis could be a complete sentence). This is most easily recognizable when the noun is an ablative in ablative absolute construction.

Vocabulary:
Augeas, Augeae (m), Augeas, king of Elis
bobile, bobilis (n), “stall”
caro, carnis (f), “flesh, meat”
Iuppiter, Iovis (m), Jupiter
purgo, purgare, purgavi, purgatus, “to clean (something, from something else)” Note that purgo can take two accusative direct objects.
quattuor (indeclinable adj.), “four”
stercus, stercoris (n), “dung, manure”

C. Literary commentary 
Choose two choices of syntax, word order, or diction that Hyginus makes in this passage that complement or enhance the meaning of the passage’s content. Discuss briefly s in 3-4 sentences. Italicize Latin words when citing them.
Hyginus chooses to use the subjunctive after ut *ut afflatu homines necaret* because he is trying to express purpose through a purpose clause. He uses the absolute ablative here *love adiutore* and here *unit flumine admisso* because he is defining the circumstances or situation in which the action of the main verb occurs.
