Option B 
Compare a passage of Hyginus with an illutration of the same subject in art. Identify the work of art, and cite at least two specific points in Hyginusâ€™ 
Latin that are similar to or different from the visual illustration.
  In Hyginus, chapter 30, section 4 there is an illustration of three people or gods and one of them has their foot on top of a bowl 
while holding a boar. The passage from Hyginus is,  aprum Erymanthium occidit. This translates to the phrase, Erymanthia killed a boar. This 
is very similar to the illustration because as I said before, it looks like someone is holding a boar and going to throw it down in order to kill it. 
Additionally, the people in the illustration are holding some sort of weapons in which they would use to kill something, in this case, a boar.
