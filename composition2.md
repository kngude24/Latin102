Review

Background 
You already know the background to this story: Deianira was tricked by Nessus into believing that the vial of poison he gave her was actually a love potion.
Instructions 
Your composition should use at least two participles and two relative clauses.
Your composition should include at least one expression of purpose using ad + a noun or pronoun modified by a gerundive.
1. Your first sentence should use a negative purpose clause to say that when Deianira, the daughter of Oeneus and the wife of Hercules saw that the beautiful young girl Iole had been brought (to her house), she began to devise a plot in order not to lose her husband (or “be deprived of” her husband).

- Cum Deianira, filia Oeneuis❌ et uxor Herculis❌ uidit Iolen adductam esse, illa cogitabat❌, ne coniugio privaretur.


2. Your second sentence should express that she sent her servant to bring to Hercules a garment dipped in the blood of the centaur Nessus, which she thought was a love potion.

- Deianira misit famulum❌ suum ut Herculi vestum ferret sanguine Nessi tinctam, quem putabat philtrum esse.

3. Your third sentence should say that Hercules put the garment on and it immediately burst into flames.

- Hercules vestum induit statimque flammavit❌

4. Your fourth sentence should express that Hercules threw the slave, whom Deianira had sent to bring the garment back, into the sea.

- Hercules famulum, quem Deianira míserat, ut vestem revocaret, in mare iecit. ✔️ **Nice!**

5. Your last sentence should express that it is reported (or said) that Hercules rose to immortality, but Deianira killed herself on account of this deed.

- Dicitur Herculem ad immortalitatem ortum esse. Deianira se interfecit ob❌ factum.
